# SegRNN: Validation and Additional Experiments
This repository implements the SegRNN algorithm from the 2023 paper "Segment Recurrent Neural Network for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting" by S. Lin et al. This project is done as a final assignment for MIPT Time Series Analysis (fall-24) course.

## Motivation
This is an educational project with the goal of expanding knowledge of the state-of-the-art (SotA) methods in time series forecasting. For this project, I set the following tasks:
* read and analyze a recent (2023-2024) paper on the SotA method of time series forecasting;
* implement the method in PyTorch with minimal guidance from the author solution;
* validate experiments provided in the paper;
* conduct additional experiments that expand on the paper.
